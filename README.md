# GAtlas - A Game Atlas for Gamers ðŸŽ®

GAtlas is a game atlas for gamers to search for their favorite games, view details, and filter by genre and platform to find the perfect game to play. It is built with Vite, React, and ChakraUI.

## Features

- **Search**: Search for games by name. The search bar uses debouncing to prevent unnecessary API calls and improve performance.

- **Responsive**: The app is responsive and works on all devices. It is built with ChakraUI, which provides a mobile-first design.
- **Vite**: The app is built with Vite, which provides fast build times and a great development experience.
