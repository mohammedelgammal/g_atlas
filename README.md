# GAtlas - A Game Atlas for Gamers ðŸŽ®

GAtlas is a gamer's paradise, designed with Vite, React, and ChakraUI. It's your one-stop destination to search, explore, and filter through a vast selection of games by genre and platform. Behind the scenes, GAtlas operates on a two-part backend: the RAWG API fetches game data, while a Node.js backend with Express and MongoDB handles user authentication. This backend ensures smooth registration, login, and profile access while keeping authentication tokens secure. With GAtlas, finding the perfect game is a breeze!

## Features

- **Search**: Search for games by name. The search bar uses debouncing to prevent unnecessary API calls and improve performance.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: View games in an infinite scrolling list. The list fetches more games as you scroll down.
- **Filter**: Filter games by genre and platform. The filter uses query caching to prevent unnecessary API calls and improve performance.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark mode. The theme is persisted in local storage.
- **Authentication**: Register and login to access the games list. The authentication is handled by a Node.js server with MongoDB as the database and JWT for token-based authentication.
- **Responsive**: The app is responsive and works on all devices. It is built with ChakraUI, which provides a mobile-first design.
- **Vite**: The app is built with Vite, which provides fast build times and a great development experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite, React - TypeScript, ChakraUI, React Query, React Hook Form, Axios, React Router Dom
- **Backend**: Node.js - TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, JWT
- **API**: [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)
